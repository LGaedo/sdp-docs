= Create a Pipeline Job

Before we get started, we'll need to create a Pipeline Job in Jenkins that we can play around with.

Feel free to reuse the Pipeline Job created during JTE: The Basics or follow the `same instructions<JTE The Basics Pipeline Job>` to create a new job for this lab.

When you're finished, you should have:

*1. A pipeline template that reads:*

[source,groovy]
----
build()
static_code_analysis()
----

*2. A pipeline configuration of:*

[source,groovy]
----
libraries {
    maven
    sonarqube
}
----

[NOTE]
====
If you're reusing the same Pipeline Job, your pipeline configuration may specify the `gradle` instead of the `maven` library. Either will do for the purposes of this lab, but switch it back to `maven` if it's different.
====

This Pipeline Job is going to be the playground where we learn about the different pipeline primitives for the rest of this lab.
